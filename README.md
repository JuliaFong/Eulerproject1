Today I decided I am going to go down the list of archived problems on Euler.net

Taken from the website:

// Problem 1

// If we list all the natural numbers below 10 that are multiples of 3 or 5, we get 3, 5, 6 and 9. The sum of these multiples is 23.

// Find the sum of all the multiples of 3 or 5 below 1000.
